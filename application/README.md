# Application

This directory contains all the custom classes and code you may have for your application to make it work. 

## User Example

Within this boilerplate application, we have an example user class which can be used like so:

```ruby
user = User.new(:username => "picat", :password => "easyas123")
```

Using this custom application code -- which should generally be able to exist without the sinatra interface -- can be the main life-blood of what makes your application amazing.
